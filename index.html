                <h2>Research</h2>
                <p>Discussing mental health wellbeing has often plagued underrepresented communities with disdain, disapproval, and mockery. These sentiments, alongside existing inequitable societal structures, have obstructed mass acceptance of the importance of caring for one's mental health.</p>
                <p>Our group decided to focus on how we might be able to help bridge the gap between people from historically marginalized communities and access to effective care.</p>
                <p>We began research by investigating existing online therapy databases to understand available resources. Our top competitors ofter databases clients can search and specify to their needs. However, we found none offer an encompassing functional experience that boasts a highly usable database and emergency information in a cohesive layout. From here, we understood that an effective UI design would be the crux of our solution.</p>
                <p>We sought to better understand underrepresented communities' experiences around mental health wellbeing. We conducted 4 interviews with participants who all identify as part of one or more historically underrepresented groups to gain insight into mental health sentiments and adaptive coping strategies.</p>
                <p>I created a research plan around 3 central themes to frame and contextualize our data collection:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Attitudes about therapy</li>
                    <li>Mental health and society</li>
                    <li>Destigmatizing strategies</li>
                </ul>
                <p>While each of our group members shared a lived experience of identifying with a historically marginalized group, we wanted to validate our assumptions by concretely learning from others about their knowledge around mental health wellbeing.</p>
                <p>We analyzed interview data through affinity mapping and found that social adversities often occur and complicate finding adequate, inclusive care across underrepresented groups. However, the path to treatment is individualistic, and the following are critical across underrepresented identities:</p>
            </div>
        </section>
    <!--Define section-->
        <section class="define">
            <div class="define content">
                <h2>Define</h2>
                <p>People with underrepresented identities searching for mental health services need a simple, reliable, comprehensive search and discovery process.<br> We believe we could help by creating a client-centered website with a reputable database of inclusive, shared-identity therapists, clear information about insurance and billing, and resources to assist individuals during critical mental health moments.</p>
            </div>
        </section>
    <!--Ideate section-->
        <section class="ideate">
            <div class="ideate content">
                <h2>Ideate</h2>
                <p>After speaking with participants and synthesizing data, we brainstormed 2 solution directions: an app or a website. While an app may effectively deliver our solution idea, onboarding users to a new ecosystem may be cumbersome for people with little motivation to seek care or urgent treatment. In turn, the on-ramping process may negatively impact adoption and engagement. After considering outreach and how we can best meet underrepresented communities with less resistance, we decided a responsive website would be most effective. Visiting a website is a familiar process for individuals of vast backgrounds and is quickly available upon opening a browser across devices and platforms.</p>

    <!--Prototype section-->
        <section class="prototype">
            <div class="prototype content">
                <h2>Prototype</h2>
                <p>From our competitor analysis and feedback captured during interviews, we knew that the therapist database should be straightforward and prominently featured. This influenced us to have the database as a primary feature on our homepage. Visitors don't have to search for it, and it would allow an efficient path to the hopeful next step in treatment, scheduling an appointment.</p>
            </div>
        </section>
    <!--Test section-->
        <section class="test">
            <div class="test content">
                <h2>Test</h2>
                <p>We conducted 4 usability tests to evaluate navigation and content strategy. We iterated our design based on task results and participant feedback.</p>
                <p>I created metrics for us to collect and monitor during testing. Metrics provided quantitative data to help ground qualitative insights gained from interviewing and usability testing. These metrics enabled us to rigorously test our website and cross-reference results against multiple data sources. It also allowed our group to envision CMHC as a business endeavor and assess future growth opportunities.</p>
                <p>Since we created a new product, I focused on visitor engagement and metrics that best tracked complimenting objectives: bounce rate, (button) conversion rates, and CTA heatmaps (via click frequency). I experienced technical difficulty producing click interaction heatmaps. However, I circumvented the issue by changing the metric to visitors' engagement via scroll length. Then, I could assess scroll lengths to validate engagement throughout the page.</p>
                <p>Testing resulted in positive outcomes for task success and establishing baseline targets. However, we received feedback to improve upon some UI challenges:</p>

                    <li>Refine the user interface to create a more seamless experience that still fits user needs but does not overwhelm them</li>
